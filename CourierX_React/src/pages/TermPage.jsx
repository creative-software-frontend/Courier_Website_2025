            credit period stipulated in the invoice. In case of delay or

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3.29.</b>
            <br /> When a Delivery attempt is made by the Delivery Agent and the
            Customer is unwilling or declines to receive the Deliverables as it
            is or it is found that the contact information of the Customer given
            in the Service Request is wrong or the Customer remains unavailable
            after various attempts by the Delivery Agent or the Order is
            canceled by the Service Requester or Customer at a stage when the
            Delivery Agent is already on the way to the Drop-off Location, it
            will be deemed to be a Failed/Canceled Delivery.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>3.30.</b>
            <br /> In case of any such Failed/Canceled delivery, the Package

            delivery attempt and the Service Requester shall be liable to pay
            Delivery as well as Return Service Fee to CourierX.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3.31.</b>
            <br /> Since Packaging offered by the Merchant at the time of
            product handover to the Delivery Agent of CourierX usually covers only
            one delivery attempt journey to the Customer, multiple delivery
            attempts due to unavailability of the Customer or a return journey
            as a result of Failed Delivery may create additional stress to the
            product Packaging in the normal course of business. CourierX shall
            ensure packages are handled with care at all times but will not
            guarantee against nor be liable for any wear and tear as a result of
            poor Packaging by the Merchant or multiple delivery attempts to
            cater to the Customer’s needs or return of the product to the
            Merchant as a result of Failed Delivery.

            CourierX are clearly established, CourierX will be liable to compensate the
            Service Requester.

            <b>3.33.</b>
